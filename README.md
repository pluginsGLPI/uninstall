# The Uninstall Materials Plugin for GLPI
 
This plugin, called "uninstall", can remove inventory equipment. It was designed, among other things, to address the following cases:

* designate inventory materials as scrap
* removing inventory due to a temporary hardware failure
* replace material by another in the warranty process for example.

The plugin includes:

* rights management directly accessible from Administration ? Profiles (in the Uninstall tab ? Plugins)
* a menu "Uninstall materials" in "Plugins"
* a menu "deinstallation" in user preferences
